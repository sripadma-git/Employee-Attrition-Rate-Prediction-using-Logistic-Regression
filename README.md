📊 Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

🤖 Model Training using Logistic Regression

📈 Model Evaluation with performance metrics

🔮 Predictions on employee attrition likelihood

🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📝 Pandas (Data Manipulation)

🔢 NumPy (Numerical Computation)

📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

🎯 Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Library)

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of employees, such as:

👥 Employee ID

📅 Age, Gender, and Job Role

💰 Salary and Benefits
